# Code and data for evaluating predictive models of the rent data set

1.  [This html file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/Comparing-models-static-version.html) contains most of the results in static html. It includes a demo for the plotly package to render interactive plots.
2.  An improved version with Shiny components is available as [https://sdsucamp.shinyapps.io/RMarkdown_Shiny/](https://sdsucamp.shinyapps.io/RMarkdown_Shiny/) Note this file is hosted on a shinyapps.io website and it takes a few seconds to render.
3.  Source code for a basic, stand-alone Shiny app can be found in the [app_basic.R file](https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/app_basic.R).
4.  An improved version of the Shiny app is deployed at [https://sdsucamp.shinyapps.io/rent/](https://sdsucamp.shinyapps.io/rent/). The [app.R](https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/app.R) file is the source code.
