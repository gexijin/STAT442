# Code and data for evaluating predictive models of the rent data set

1.  [This html file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/Prediction_evaluation.html) contains most of the results in static html.
2.  The source code in  [Quarto](https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/Prediction_evaluation.qmd). Most of the code was written by ChatGPT.
3.  To further visializing the predictions and biases, a Shiny app is deployed at [https://bioge.shinyapps.io/rent23/](https://bioge.shinyapps.io/rent23/). The [app.R](https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/app.R) file is the source code.
 
Congratulation to Daniel Burkhalter and Noah Stewart for winning the 2023 competition! Akin & Mitu is at second place. Addy's model is at 3rd place. The top 8 models are actually very successful in predicting rent with about 30-33% error. Congratulations to all for successfully completing this project.
