# Code and data for evaluating predictive models of the rent data set

1.  [This html file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/Prediction_evaluation.html) contains most of the results in static html. It includes a demo for the plotly package to render interactive plots.
2.  The source code in  [Quarto](https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/Prediction_evaluation.qmd). Most of the code is written by ChatGPT.
3.  To further visializing the predictions and biases, a Shiny app is deployed at [https://bioge.shinyapps.io/rent23/](https://bioge.shinyapps.io/rent23/). The [app.R](https://github.com/gexijin/stat442/blob/main/app.R) file is the source code.
